## Model

Linear regression with combined L1 and L2 priors as regularizer.

Minimizes the objective function:

```
1 / (2 * n_samples) * ||y - Xw||^2_2
+ alpha * l1_ratio * ||w||_1
+ 0.5 * alpha * (1 - l1_ratio) * ||w||^2_2
```

If you are interested in controlling the L1 and L2 penalty separately, keep in mind that this is equivalent to:

```
a * L1 + b * L2
```
where:

```
alpha = a + b and l1_ratio = a / (a + b)
```

The parameter l1_ratio corresponds to alpha in the glmnet R package while alpha corresponds to the lambda parameter in glmnet. Specifically, l1_ratio = 1 is the lasso penalty. Currently, l1_ratio <= 0.01 is not reliable, unless you supply your own sequence of alpha.

**Data Set Information:**

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult: [Web Link] or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.
